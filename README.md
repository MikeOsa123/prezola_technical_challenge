Technical test for The Wedding Shop


## Improvements

- Would have included social media Authenticaton as part of the Login process.
- Give guests the option to login so that the next time the guest visits the page for this or another person's wedding gift list their details will be remembered.
- Would have used Elastic search to allow users to use natural language to look for products.
- Data storage I would have used a PostgreSQL database that would have been running on a separate server.
- Used Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer to manage incoming traffic.
- Would have used Docker compose to containerise each service Nginx, Postgres, Gunicorn and Flask.
